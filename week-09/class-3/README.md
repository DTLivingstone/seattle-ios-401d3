#Week 9 - Class 3
* Implement KVO somewhere in your project.
* Convert your TableViewCell to a Nib to use in your TableView's
  * User Nib should have a user's profile image, nameLabel, and reputation.
  * Question Nib should have title, owner's name, and isAnswered label.
  * Use GCD and dispatch_queue's to load the images from profileImageURL.
* **Bonus:**
  * Using Dispatch groups, show an alert view once all images have been downloaded (The downloads should be waterfall style, not lazy!).
  * Using the endpoint `/me`, do another fetch, add a 3rd ViewController to the containerViewController, and display the logged in users's data.
