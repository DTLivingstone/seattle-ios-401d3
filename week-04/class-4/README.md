#Week 4 - Class 4
##Homework
* Create a UserSearchViewController that searches for users, similar to how we are already searching for repositories. Instead of a table view, use a collection view to display the users avatar image.
* Upon clicking on a cell, implement a custom transition, and transition the image clicked on to a UserDetailViewController page that has their picture, name, and whatever other info you want pulled from their API.
* Implementent Regex in your app. Use it to validate the characters the user types into the search bar. Extend String with this functionality.
* Implement WKWebView in your app. When a user clicks on a repo, show their repo's web page with WKWebView.
* **Code Challenge:**
	* Given a string, return a string where for every char in the original, there are two chars.
			* Example: doubleChar("The") â†’ "TThhee"
* **Bonus:**
	*
